When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When we want to share our work or when we want to access our work remotely on different machines.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	We can keep track of changes and pull or push based on when we want to do it. We can also understand and resolve any conflicts that occur.
