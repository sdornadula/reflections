When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When we want to share our work or when we want to access our work remotely on different machines.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	We can keep track of changes and pull or push based on when we want to do it. We can also understand and resolve any conflicts that occur.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Branches -- We can create branches when we work locally on a project.
	Clones   -- We can clone on GitHub and also locally.
	Forks    -- When we create copies on GitHub and do not want to change the original repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	We can fetch all the changes based on that and also merge easily.
